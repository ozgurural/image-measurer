# Image-Measurer: Interactive Distance Measurement on Images

Image-Measurer is a Python application that allows you to measure distances in an image. The measurements are calculated in pixels and can be converted into real-world dimensions based on a reference distance provided by the user.

## Features

- Interactive Measurements: Draw lines directly on the image to measure distances.
- Real World Scaling: Provide a reference distance to calibrate measurements to real-world scales.
- Multiple Distances: Measure multiple distances in a single image session.
- Easy-to-Use Interface: Built with simplicity in mind.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or later
- OpenCV
- numpy
- tkinter
- PySimpleGUI

## Installation

You can install the necessary packages using pip:

\`\`\`
pip install opencv-python numpy tkinter PySimpleGUI
\`\`\`

Clone this repo to your local machine using:

\`\`\`
git clone https://github.com/ozgurural/image-measurer.git
\`\`\`

## Usage

After installation, you can run the program with:

\`\`\`
python image_measurer.py
\`\`\`

Once the application is running, follow the prompts in the application window. Select an image file and start measuring!
