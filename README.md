# Image-Measurer: Interactive Distance Measurement on Images

![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)

Image-Measurer is a sophisticated Python application that enables users to interactively measure distances on an image. It uses the PyQt5 library to provide an intuitive and user-friendly interface for drawing lines and making measurements, with the option to save your work as an image file.

## Key Features

- **Interactive Measurements:** Draw lines directly on the image to measure distances.
- **Real-World Scaling:** Calibrate your measurements by providing a real-world reference distance.
- **Zooming and Panning:** Use the mouse wheel to zoom in and out of the image, and the right mouse button to pan.
- **Save Your Work:** Save your measurements as a PNG, JPEG, or other image format.

## Prerequisites

To use Image-Measurer, you'll need the following:

- Python 3.8 or later
- PyQt5
- numpy

## Installation

1. Install the necessary Python packages using pip:

    ```bash
    pip install PyQt5 numpy
    ```

2. Clone this repository to your local machine:
